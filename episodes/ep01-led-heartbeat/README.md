# Episode 01 — At a Blink of a LED (LED Heartbeat)

This episode builds the timing foundation of the Fern Station firmware.

We implement a non-blocking LED heartbeat using `millis()` instead of `delay()`.

## 🔌 Wiring

GPIO 23 → LED Anode  
LED Cathode → 220Ω → GND

Ensure resistor is placed in series.

Recommended LED current:
~10–15mA

## 🧠 Firmware Concept

We avoid `delay()` to keep the system responsive.

Instead, we:
- Store a static timestamp
- Compare with `millis()`
- Toggle the LED when interval expires

This pattern becomes the timing backbone for all future episodes.

## 🚀 How to Upload

1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Select Board: ESP32 Dev Module
3. Select correct COM port
4. Upload firmware
5. Open Serial Monitor at 115200 baud

## 🧪 Expected Output

LED blinks every second.

Serial Monitor prints:
Beep
Beep
Beep

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- Ensure correct board is selected.
- Install ESP32 board package.
- Verify correct GPIO pin number.
