# Fern Station

Fern Station is a structured embedded systems build series using ESP32.

This repository accompanies this SneakyFoxDev YouTube series and contains:
- Full firmware per episode
- Wiring documentation
- Bill of materials
- Engineering explanations

The project evolves incrementally. Each episode adds a new architectural layer.

## 🔥 Latest Episode

### Episode 01 — LED Heartbeat

In this episode we implement a non-blocking LED timing loop using [`millis()`](https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/time/millis/).  
This establishes the firmware timing architecture for the entire system.

🎬 Watch on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMF0cNxmGCw).
